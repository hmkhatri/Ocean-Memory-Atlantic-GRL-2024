# Ocean Memory Approach for Analysing the North Atlantic Ocean Variability 

The repository contains scripts for analysis of decadal variability in ocean temperatures using observations and climate model outputs. A new ocean memory framework, which accounts for fast and slow change in the ocean state, is proposed to examine North Atlantic Ocean variability in terms of the North Atlantic Oscillation [Khatri et al. (2024)]. Post-processed data required for creating figures can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13306349](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13306349).
