# Ocean Memory Approach for Analysing the North Atlantic Ocean Variability 

The repository contains scripts for analysis of decadal variability in ocean temperatures using observations and climate model outputs. A new ocean memory framework, which accounts for fast and slow change in the ocean state, is proposed to examine North Atlantic Ocean variability in terms of the North Atlantic Oscillation [Khatri et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.172499892.28636741/v1). 

Python scripts for computing diagnsotics are in [Python-Scripts](./Python-Scripts) and plotting notebooks are in [Plots](./Plots). Post-processed data required for creating figures can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13306349](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13306349). 

A tutorial on creating NAO-based composites, which are used to identify an appropriate form of the linear response (or Green) function for temperature anomalies, is avaiable in [NAO-SST-Composite](./Tutorials/NAO-SST-Composite.ipynb). The same approach also applies to other ocean diagnostics, see [Khatri et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL101480).
