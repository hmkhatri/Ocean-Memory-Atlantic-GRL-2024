# Ocean Memory Approach for Analysing the North Atlantic Ocean Variability 

The repository contains scripts for analysis of decadal variability in ocean temperatures using observations and climate model outputs. A new ocean memory framework, which accounts for fast and slow change in the ocean state, is proposed to examine North Atlantic Ocean variability in terms of the North Atlantic Oscillation [Khatri et al. (2024)](10.22541/essoar.172499892.28636741/v1). 

Python scripts for computing diagnsotics are in [Python-Scripts](./Python-Scripts) and plotting notebooks are in [Plots](./Plots). Post-processed data required for creating figures can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13306349](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13306349).
